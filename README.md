# Video → Audio → Transcription Pipeline

A simple, production-style multimodal pipeline that:
1. Takes a video file (MP4)
2. Extracts the audio track
3. Sends the audio to Whisper / OpenAI API for transcription
4. Saves the output transcript to file (or cloud storage)

## 🚀 Why This Project?
This repo demonstrates:
- Python backend engineering
- Multimodal data processing
- Audio extraction using FFmpeg
- AI inference integration (OpenAI Whisper)
- Pipeline structuring (separation of concerns)
- Clean, modular code

Designed to showcase skills relevant for AI product engineering teams like **Canopy Labs**, especially with speech/motion multimodal workflows.
